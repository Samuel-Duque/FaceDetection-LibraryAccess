# This project aims to improve my college's library

My library needs the student ID to grant access to books and laptops, but itâ€™s really common for students to forget it since it's such a long number (like `123123213123`). To remember it, they have to ask the staff to print a paper with their ID on it.

So... What's the best way to improve a human process? Automatize it! That's exactly what we're doing here. The core project is to create a Face Recognition model to `recognize` (of course) all students by their _beautiful faces_ and avoid that boring and energy-wasting problem about memorizing that huge student ID number (Gen Z's problem...) and etc., etc.
